# Redux Pending Middleware

A redux [middleware](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware) which tracks your asynchronous [redux](http://redux.js.org) actions (effects) and informs about the progress through selector function.

<br/>

List of supported libraries that process redux effects:

- [redux-toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit)
- [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)
- [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) / [redux-promise-middleware](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware)

It's worth mention that `redux-pending-middleware` allows you to code simultaneously with all the above libraries simultaneously.

<br/>

## Quick start

```shell script
npm install redux-pending-middleware
```

Depending on what you use in the project, import into the project. Now let's dwell on this in more detail.

### [redux-toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit)

This approach is simplest and clear. Just add the middleware and use your regular toolkit async actions as usual.

```javascript
import { configureStore, getDefaultMiddleware } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { reduxPendingToolkitMiddleware } from 'redux-pending-middleware';
import { rootReducer as reducer } from './root.reducer';

const defaultMiddlewares = getDefaultMiddleware();
const middleware = [reduxPendingToolkitMiddleware, ...defaultMiddlewares];

export const store = configureStore({ reducer, middleware });
```

### [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)

This approach is that you need to wrap the saga worker.
This allows to track the start and end of the effect.

```javascript
import { trackWorker } from 'redux-pending-middleware';
import { call, put, takeEvery } from '@redux-saga/core/effects';

function* getPlanets() {
  yield takeEvery(getPlanetsRequest.type, trackWorker(handleGetPlanets));
}

function* handleGetPlanets() {
  const planets = yield call(Api.getPlanets);
  yield put(getPlanetsCompleted(planets));
}
```

This approach successfully combined with custom wrappers on top of the worker, for example, error handling.

```javascript
const workerWrapper = worker => {
  return trackWorker(customWrapper);

  function* customWrapper(...args) {
    try {
      yield* worker(...args);
    } catch (error) {
      yield put(setFetchError(error));
    }
  }
};
```

### [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) / [redux-promise-middleware](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware)

Ok, here I need to explain the problem a bit

Itâ€™s not entirely true this package supports `redux-thunk`, but the truth is that you can forward promises to payload. 
That is the way `redux-promise-middleware` does. At the moment, this library completely replaces `redux-promise-middleware`.
In the plans, through the collaboration, expand the API of `redux-promise-middleware` in order to reuse their code.

For details, you can go to read the documentation of `redux-promise-middleware` about how this works.

In short, everything is quite simple.
You pass Promise as payload and we will have stateful types inside the reducer. 
Let's say we have action type `GET_PLANETS`, so when we call our action with a type and a promise in the payload, it first triggers a reducer with `GET_PLANETS_PENDING`.
Then, when our promise resolved, we will have `GET_PLANETS_FULFILLED` type inside the reducer, and a value of resolved promise as a payload. 
But, if an error occurs in our promise, then we get the type `GET_PLANETS_REJECTED` with a reason within property payload.

```javascript
import { configureStore, getDefaultMiddleware } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { reduxPendingPromiseMiddleware } from 'redux-pending-middleware';
import { rootReducer as reducer } from './root.reducer';

const defaultMiddlewares = getDefaultMiddleware();
const middleware = [reduxPendingPromiseMiddleware, ...defaultMiddlewares];

export const store = configureStore({ reducer, middleware });

/**
 * somewhere in the /src
 * saga usage example with trackWorker
 */
function getPlanets() {
    return { 
        type: 'GET_PLANETS',
        payload: fetch('planets')
    }
}
```

### Connecting the dots

For everything to work at the same time, you need to use all the previous steps

```javascript
import { configureStore, getDefaultMiddleware } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import {
  reduxPendingPromiseMiddleware,
  reduxPendingToolkitMiddleware,
  trackWorker
} from 'redux-pending-middleware';
import createSagaMiddleware from '@redux-saga/core';
import { call, put, takeEvery } from '@redux-saga/core/effects';
import { rootReducer as reducer } from './root.reducer';
import { rootSaga } from './root.saga';

const defaultMiddlewares = getDefaultMiddleware();
const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();
const middleware = [
  reduxPendingPromiseMiddleware,
  reduxPendingToolkitMiddleware,
  sagaMiddleware,
  ...defaultMiddlewares
];

export const store = configureStore({ reducer, middleware });

sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);

/**
 * somewhere in the /src
 * saga usage example with trackWorker
 */
function* getPlanets() {
  yield takeEvery(getPlanetsRequest.type, trackWorker(handleGetPlanets));
}

function* handleGetPlanets() {
  const planets = yield call(Api.getPlanets);
  yield put(getPlanetsCompleted(planets));
}
```
